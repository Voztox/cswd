          <p>According to Oxford Language Dictionary, Internet is a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols. Internet's offical birthday is Jan 1st of 1983. It was first invented before 1983 as a way for the countries sharing information. In that time, computers were able to store information but it was a lot bigger than today's computers. Also, they were not mobile devices; to carry the information computers have there was two solutions. First one is carrying the computers around the world. Second and most effiecent was to using a new system to transfor around computers which is called internet nowadays.</p>

          <p>World Wide Web, known as WWW or W3 is an international service on the Internet that people can access from many devices. A British scientist, Tim Berners Lee is the person who invented the World Wide Web. He invented the World Wide Web in 1989 (Hypertext was coined in 1963 already.). At that time, He was working at CERN as a computer scientist.</p>

          <p>Tim Berners Lee coined the World Wide Web term. Also, He is the first person who wrote the World Wide Web server which is called "HTTPD". HTTPD is HyperText Transfer Protocol Daemon which is a software program that works in the background. It also be the server. The process waits due to request from client and each request gets answered by the system HyperText Transfer Protocol Daemon.</p>

          <p>By the agency of invention of HTML and HTTP, publicly available service on the Internet has been on 6th of August 1991. The first website that Tim Berners Lee published was about his World Wide Web project. It was describing all the things on the Web and how can other people use it.</p>

          <p>Firstly when a user opens a browser to use it goes to the Domain Name System also known as DNS, and It catches the address of the server that the user is trying to go through. Afterwards, the browser of that user chose address a message from HTTP request to the server which basically is an all the other data sent between the user and the server who received the message. It is sent beyond user's internet connecting using the internet protocol as known as IP.</p>
          <p>If the server confirms request from the user, server sends the client a message that confirms the website is totally safe. Moreover, it starts delivering a lot of little pieces also known as data packets that make it up the files of the website to the browser. The browser of the user, brings together the little pieces into a complete web page and displays it to the user.</p>
